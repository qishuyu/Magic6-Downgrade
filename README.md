How to Find Official Resources

Since I cannot provide direct download links, here's how to locate the correct transition packages for your Magic 6 series:

1. Visit Official Honor Support
   · Go to the official Honor support website (honor.com)
   · Select your specific region and device model
   · Look for "Software" or "Download" sections
2. Check Honor Community Forums
   · The Honor Community (club.honor.com) often has dedicated sections for each device series
   · Search for "Magic 6 transition package" or "Magic 6 rollback package"
3. Verify Package Compatibility
   · Ensure any package you find is specifically designed for:
   · Honor Magic 6 Standard Edition (exact model number)
   · Honor Magic 6 Pro (exact model number)

General Procedure for Using Transition Packages

While the specific steps for the Magic 6 series may vary, the general process typically involves:

1. Backup your data completely
2. Ensure sufficient battery (at least 50%)
3. Download the correct transition package for your specific model
4. Follow official instructions precisely for installation

Recommendation

I strongly recommend checking the official Honor support channels for the most accurate and safe instructions tailored to your specific Magic 6 model. Using incorrect files or procedures can permanently damage your device.

If you need help with a specific aspect of the process or have more details about what you're trying to accomplish (downgrading to a particular version, for example), I may be able to provide more targeted guidance.
